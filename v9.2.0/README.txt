---ABOUT THE PROGRAM---
grav_simulator is a code that tries to simulate gravity systems of 2 or more objects. The
code is in current update to make it faster and easy to use, also to interpret inside a
python interface.

---TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM---
-Python 3x must be installed. (if not run try python3 interface.pyw)
-The libraries required are: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, bokeh, tkinter, os and sys.
-The program was made for windows interfaces. To execute correctly in Linux and MacOs, lines
using bokeh, os and sys libraries must be updated.

---NOTE---
-To execute the program you may run interface.pyw (if not open try with Powershell or CMD).
-The alteration of the filenames of .py and the assets path may alter the funcionality of
the simulator
-It is highly recommended to use known values to avoid colisions between systems. (An update
of collisions is in progress but the time of release is not certain).
-Some parts of the code sintaxis in declaration of variables are in spanish, an english
update of the variables is being made, at the same time an update with comments to explain
the different functions and classes is in current development.

---FROM THE AUTHOR---
-Don't steal this code, use it to learn.
